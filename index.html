			<h2>Services</h2>
			<p>I specialise in tutoring Computer Science up to and including A-levels. (18 years old)</p>
			<p>However, even if you aren't taking British exams, feel free to contact me anyway! The content 
				between different countries can be very similar, even if the exams are structured differently.
			</p>
			<p>Additionally, feel free to contact me in regards to other mathematical subjects such as Maths, 
				Physics and Further Maths, which I studied up to A-level.

				<section id ="profile">
					<p>Hi there, I'm Dylan! I currently study Computer Science at the University of Bath,
					and I enjoy cooking, hiking and watching films in my spare time. I've been studying Computer Science
					since I was 11 years old, and am currently in my third year of University, so you could say I have a 
					fair bit of experience in the subject!
					</p>
					<p>
					Although I specialise in teaching Computer Science, I'm also familiar with other 
					mathematically based subjects (having studied them until I started going to University). 
					If you're not sure about whether I can help you, feel free to email
					me anyway and I'll let you know if I can help!
					</p>
					<p>
					I offer the first session for free so you can see whether I'm a good match.
					</p>

			<h2>Pricing</h2>
			<p>I offer sessions at £40* per hour for a single student and £20* per hour to be part of a group session 
				(6 students or fewer). This reflects the planning which goes into creating learning materials tailored 
				to the student prior to the lesson.
			</p>
