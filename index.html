			<p>Hi, I’m Dylan!</p>
			<p>I teach programming online and around the Bath area, with over 5 years of experience.</p>
			<p>I also have plenty of experience tutoring STEM subjects (Science, Technology, Engineering, Maths and other related subjects), so feel free to email me about that too!</p>
			<p>I’m available for sessions at any frequency (weekly/ monthly etc.) and I offer the first one for free, so can get to know each other better first and see if we’re a good fit.</p>
			<p>I can tailor sessions for exam preparation, as well as for extracurricular learning, meaning I can suit your needs, whatever they are.</p>
			<h3>My Method of Teaching</h3>
			<p>My lessons typically consist of the following structure:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>First, I recap the topics from the previous lesson and link it into the current lesson, to allow a sense of continuity.</li>
				<li>I then teach the current topic, using plenty of examples to embed understanding.</li>
				<li>We go through some brief exercises to then reinforce that understanding.</li>
				<li>I set some (optional!) homework to strengthen the learning, and so that the lessons don’t get too bogged down with too many exercises.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>I also use the following teaching techniques (depending on which work best for each student):</p>
			<ul>
				<li>I always go at the student’s pace, checking in every now and again to make sure they understand everything.</li>
				<li>I never teach at the student, I always teach to the student: by not just stating facts they need to memorise, but by carefully explaining the content.</li>
				<li>I provide exercises during the class and as homework to deepen understanding and cement topics further, especially since doing something can be a much better way to learn than just hearing about it.</li>
				<li>I make lessons fun and engaging by keeping them light and varied, and by showing their relevancy in the world.</li>
				<li>I use visual examples to emphasise what I am explaining.</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>About Me</h2>

				<section id ="profile">
					<p>Hi there, I'm Dylan! I currently study Computer Science at the University of Bath, and I enjoy cooking, hiking, and watching films in my spare time. I've been studying Computer Science since I was 11 years old, and am currently in my third year of University, so you could say I have a fair bit of experience in the subject!</p>
					<p>I’ve also been tutoring STEM subjects for around 5 years, both independently and for various companies, so I have a lot of experience teaching students of all ages. In any case, if you’re not sure whether I can help you, feel free to email me anyway and I'll let you know if I can!</p>

			<h2>Pricing</h2>
			<p>I offer the first session for free, so that we can get to know each other better, and so that I can show you my expertise in person.</p>
			<p>After that, I offer sessions at £30* per hour for a single student and £15* per hour to be part of a group session (6 students or fewer). This reflects the planning which goes into creating learning materials tailored to the student prior to the lesson. </p>
			<p>* (or the equivalent in your native currency)</p>
