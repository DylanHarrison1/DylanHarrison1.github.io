			<h2>Services</h2>
			
			<p>I specialise in tutoring STEM subjects (Science, Technology, Engineering, Maths and other related subjects) with a particular focus on Coding and Computer Science.</p>
			<p>Being British, I have a better understanding of the content and structure of British exams than those from other countries. However, even if you aren't taking British exams, feel free to contact me anyway! The content between different countries is often very similar even if the exams are structured a little differently. </p>
			<p>I am available for regular sessions at whatever interval you would like, and I offer the first session for free so that we can get to know each other better before properly starting the course!</p>
			<h3>My Method of Teaching</h3>
			<p>In my time as a student, I have had many great, and many awful teachers, and I try to learn lessons from both to improve my technique:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>I recap old topics often to reinforce them into the student’s understanding.</li>
				<li>I do my best not just to tell the student about a topic, but to explain it clearly, since this makes it easier to remember as opposed to disjointed facts.</li>
				<li>I provide exercises during the class and as homework to deepen understanding and cement topics further, especially since doing something can be a much better way to learn than just hearing about it.</li>
				<li>I make lessons fun and engaging by keeping them light and varied, and by showing their relevancy in the world.</li>
				<li>I use visual examples to emphasise what I am explaining.</li>
			</ul>
<p>Not all of these methods will work on every student; everybody is unique. Therefore, over the first few lessons, I aim to learn which of these methods works best for each student in order to achieve the best learning experience for future lessons.</p>

			<h2>About Me</h2>
			<section id="profile-details">
				<section id ="profile">
					<p>Hi there, I'm Dylan! I currently study Computer Science at the University of Bath, and I enjoy cooking, hiking, and watching films in my spare time. I've been studying Computer Science since I was 11 years old, and am currently in my third year of University, so you could say I have a fair bit of experience in the subject!</p>
					<p>I’ve also been tutoring STEM subjects for around 5 years, both independently and for various companies, so I have a lot of experience teaching students of all ages.</p>
					<p>Although I specialise in teaching Computer Science, I'm also familiar with other mathematically based subjects, having studied Maths, Further Maths and Physics until University and getting top grades in all! (feel free to inquire!) If you're not sure about whether I can help you, feel free to email me anyway and I'll let you know if I can!</p>
					<p>If you’re interested in having me tutor your child, I offer the first session for free so you can see whether I'm a good match.</p>

			<h2>Pricing</h2>
			<p>I offer sessions at £40* per hour for a single student and £20* per hour to be part of a group session 
				(6 students or fewer). This reflects the planning which goes into creating learning materials tailored 
				to the student prior to the lesson.
